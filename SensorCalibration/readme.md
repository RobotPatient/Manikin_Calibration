# Characterization and Calibration on the SensorHub

This program works with on the SensorHub (samd21), It uses the Arduino framework. With Serial.print() it pushes measured datapoints to make sensor characterization easier for the Finger position sensors. It also calibrates the Finger position sensors and detects faulty sensors
